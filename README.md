## Setup

Clone the project to your machine

1. Open termial, `cd` into `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Open termial, `cd` into `server` folder.
4. Run `npm install`

## Run

1. From `server` folder run `npm start`.
2. From `client` folder run `npm start`.
3. Open the [application](http://localhost:3000) in a browser window, enter user name and join chat.
4. Open the [application](http://localhost:3000) in a ***new browser window***, enter user name and join chat.

## Troubleshooting

The client runs on port `3000` and server on port `4000`. If the ports are not free then the application will not function. Update the ports in source code or free up these ports to continue.
